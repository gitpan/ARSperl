 </HEAD>
 <BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

 The following lists the changes that have been made
 for each release of ARSperl.
 <P>
 <DL>

    <DT> 1.61 <DD>
    <UL>
  <LI>  new utility: example/AddUsersToGroup.pl - bulk add a bunch
		of users to a specified group 
  <LI>  new utility: example/DelUsersFromGroup.pl - bulk delete a bunch
		of users from a specified group 
  <LI>  fixed various problems with join schema entry-id handling
  <LI>  fixed uninitialized variable warnings
  <LI>  fixed bug in indexList returned by ars_GetSchema()
  <LI>  updated all Get&lt;object&gt; functions so that changeDiary
          is fully decoded. 
  <LI>  changed return value of ars_DeleteEntry() so that
           ars_DeleteEntry() || die() will work as expected. 
  <LI>  fixed problem in example/Show_ALink.pl
  <LI>  added/updated helper func: ars_decodeStatusHistory()
  <LI>  added example/ars_decodeStatusHistory.pl
  <LI>  fixed ars_GetSchema typo/bug w/regards to adminGroupList
  <LI>  fixed GetField.pl example so that it decodes everything
  <LI>  patch for bug in ars_GetServerInfo()
  <LI>  updated Makefile.PL to dynamically generate the support.h
           file based on the ar.h file specified.
    </UL>

    <DT> 1.6001 BETA <DD>
    <UL>
  <LI>   patch for bug in ars_CreateEntry()

  <LI>  added ARS32 conditional compilation for AdminExtension 
           routines (which were removed as of ars3.2 api)
    </UL>

    <DT> 1.6000 BETA <DD>
    <UL>
  <LI>   removed most of the PPERLC and AWP stuff that was intended
           to help the port to ActiveState perl.  Use the One True Perl.
 
  <LI>   Changed many of the allocations to use perl's memory manager,
           except where the structure or element is grown further internally
           by ARS, or where the structure is non-trivial to free().  I still
           have concerns about some of the un-freed allocations in 
           supportrev.c, but at least ALL of the demo scripts, 
           including ARSDoc-1.11 (with small patch submitted to list) now 
           run, and produce the right results.
 
  <LI>   Removed all references to ZEROMEM in favor of perl's Zero, which
           is guaranteed to work everywhere, and doesn't need additional logic.
 
  <LI>   fixed a couple of small typos, including one in a elliptical 
           declaration (...) which didn't have a comma separator.
 
  <LI>   Changed the logic of CVLD in one place that was attempting to free()
           null pointers.
    </UL>

    <DT> 1.56 <DD>

  <LI>  patched perl_BuildEntryIdList to make it more robust
           (Ulrich Pfeifer &lt;pfeifer@wait.de&gt;)

           return a qualifier for query menus" (D.J.Adams@soton.ac.uk)

    </UL>
    <DT> 1.5203 (beta) <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI>  beginnings of a WinNT port (not completed yet)
      <LI>  added "timestamp" to the return hash of GetEscalation()
      <LI>  added some extra malloc/free debugging stuff
    </UL>
    <DT> 1.5202 (beta) <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI> removed some debugging code that was left in
    </UL>

    </UL>

    </UL>
    <DT> 1.51 (beta) <DD>

    </UL>
    <DT> 1.50 (beta) <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI> removed ars_errstr from C code. replaced with ars_errhash.
           modified ARS.pm to refer to hash when $ars_errstr is 
           accessed. $ars_errstr no longer tie'd to main:: package.
 
      <LI> bug fix (Sid Van den Heede) "affecting getting of
           displayInstanceList"
 
      <LI> bug fix (James LewisMoss) for ars_GetCharMenu()
 
      <LI> bug fix (Ian Flanigan) for perl_ARIndexStruct()
 
      <LI> modified GetListEntry(), GetEntry(), SetEntry() and 
           DeleteEntry() to make operations on join schemas 
           transparent.
 
      <LI> added a ARVerifyUser call to ars_Login so that
           ars_Login() || die() will work as one would expect it to.
 
      <LI> added $VERSION to the perl module file.
 
      <LI> added "log to file" action to GetFilter action hash 
           (requested by D.J.Adams@soton.ac.uk)
 
      <LI> added updated doc tree to main distribution (contributed by
           D.J.Adams@soton.ac.uk)
 
      <LI> new functions and doc on new functions and new examples for some
           of these new functions.
 
      <LI> altered return value of perl_ARStatusStruct so that it 
           returns a hash of the various StatusStruct members so that
           reversing the operation is simpler. scripts that, for example,
           retrieve active link definitions and print them out that previous
           expected the {message} key to point to a string will need to
           be updated.
 
      <LI> added valueType to the assign structure to assist in 
           reversing the operation (converting perl to C API assign 
           structure).
 
      <LI> added displayTag as an optional parameter to ars_LoadQualifier()
           so that you can build queries against customized views (that
           are stored on the server).

      <LI> altered ARError() so that return codes of OK or WARNING don't
           signal an error. For example, GetListEntries would return
           nothing if you matched more than the max allowed, now it returns
           the max allowable number of records and places a warning message
           into the error hash.

    <DT> 1.44 <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI> added some extra code to assist in decoding
           qualifier structures
      <LI> included PrintQual.pl and ars_QualDecode.pl examples
           to show how to do it.
      <LI> modified GetFilter.pl example to dump the qualification
           that is on the filter.

            more efficient.
 
      <LI> New functions: ars_GetFilter(), ars_GetCharMenu(), 
                ars_GetServerStatistics
 
      <LI> Internal GetField call now caches results to minimize
                number of queries made.
