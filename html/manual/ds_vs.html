<H4>Value Structure</H4>

ARValueStruct is just converted to the associated perl type, except for
keywords.  Keywords are denoted by a string surrounded by nulls.  For example,
$TIMESTAMP$ is converted to the perl string "\0timestamp\0".  C doesn't
allow nulls in strings so this doesn't introduce any ambiguity.
