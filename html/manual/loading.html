<H3>Loading the Extension</H3>

To load the extension you must have '<B>use ARS;</B>' at the
beginning of a perl script.  

<P>

The added perl functions more or less match the ones in the C API. 

<P>

It should be noted that, at present, only functions
pertinent to client usage are integrated. Functions that would be used, for
instance, by the admin application are not integrated <I>(i.e. functions for
creating schemas,active links, etc. Only functions to fetch schemas, active
links, submit and modify data are available)</I>.  

<P>
