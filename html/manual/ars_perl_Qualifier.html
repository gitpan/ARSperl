   <H2><CODE>ars_perl_Qualifier($qual)</CODE></H2>

      This function returns a Hash that contains a processed
      version of the qualifier structer (i.e. what is retured
      by ars_LoadQualifier or what is encoded in the qualifier structure
      that appears when you examine Filters and Active links via
      the Perl extension). You can then walk the various
      segments of the Hash and interpret the Qualifier.  <P>
      Note that this is a fairly complex Hash and if all you want
      to do is <I>see</I> the qualifier in a readable form (and
      not interpret it) you might just want to call 
      <A HREF="ars_Export.html">ars_Export</A> and extract the
      readable qualifier from the return value of that routine.

      <DL>
          <DT><B>On success</B><DD>
              Returns the new entry id.
          <DT><B>On failure</B><DD>
              Returns <CODE>undef</CODE>.
      </DL>

      <P>Example:

      <PRE>
      ($entry_id = ars_CreateEntry($c, "Schema01", $id, $val)) || 
            die $ars_errstr;
      </PRE>

      <P>Hash:

the hash returned by ars_perl_Qualifier has these members:<P>

on this Hash in the future</B></CENTER>

 oper   = "and", "or", "not", "rel_op"
 left   = qualifier             (only for and, or)
 right  = qualifier             (only for and, or)
 not    = qualifier             (only for not)
 rel_op = rel_op                (only for rel_op)

a rel_op is:
 oper   = "==", ">", ">=", "<", "<=", "!=", "like", "in"
 left   = FieldValueOrArithStruct 
 right  = FieldValueOrArithStruct

FieldValueOrArithStruct is:
 fieldId        = integer 
 value          = scalar value (integer, string, float, etc.) 
 arith          = ArithOpStruct 
 statHistory    = StatHistoryValue
 valueSet       = list of scalar values 
 variable       = integer       /* I think this is for passing
                                   macro arguments */ 
 queryValue     = QueryValueStruct 
 queryCurrent   = integer
