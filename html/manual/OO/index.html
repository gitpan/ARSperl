<H1>ARSperl Programmer's Manual - OO Layer Overview</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2> Objective </H2>

Since there are several (at least 3) separate OO layers out there, some of
      which work on top of ARSperl and some of which don't, I decided to
      implement a layer ontop of ARSperl so that you get all of the
      features of ARSperl as well as an OO layer for a subset of those
      features.

<H2> Features </H2>

The following features are available as part of the OO layer.

<DL>
<DT> <B> Exception Handlers </B> <DD>

        The OO layer abstracts exception handling away a bit (optionally,
	ofcourse). By default, the layer installs three handlers that are
	called if an FATAL, ERROR, or WARNING return code is returned by
	the ARS C API. At first, these handlers map to the Perl "die" and
	"warn" functions. You can, however, disable or over-ride this
	feature and install your own handlers. <P>

	Have a look at the <A href="connection.html#new">Connection Object's   
        constructor method</A>. <P>

        Also examine the <code>t/entry.t</code> script available in the
        source distribution for an example of how to use this. <P>

        Basically, what this means is you don't have to test the
        return code of each call you make. If a call encounters a problem
	while doing it's job, it'll call an exception handler to handle
	the problem.<P>

<DT> <B> Wide Variety of API Calls </B> <DD>

	Since the OO layer is written ontop of ARSperl itself, you can "mix 
	and match" the two within scripts. This allows you access to all of 
	the API calls you've come to use while allowing you to utilize some 
	OOP practices where available. You don't need to login twice, the
	OO layer and the class functional layer can share a single control
	record. <P>

<DT> <B> Automatic Type Conversion </B> <DD>

        The OO layer converts enumeration values on the fly for you. This
	is done on 
	<a href="connection.html#create">creates</a>,
	<a href="connection.html#set">sets</A> and
	<a href="connection.html#get">gets</a>. You no longer have to lookup
	with enumeration values yourself. <P>

<DT> <B> Named Parameters </B> <DD>

	All of the OO layer's methods accept named parameters so you don't
	have to remember what the correct parameter order is. You can
	optionally leave out the named parameter portion (if you like) but
	then you'll need to be sure you get the order right (just like in
	the "classic", i.e. ars_*, function calls).<P> 
        Also noteworthy is that the named parameters are case-insensitive.<P>

<DT> <B> Parameter Checking </B> <DD>

	Finally, if you utilize Named Parameters, then the methods will
	check to make sure you specified the minimum number of parameters
	and will put up a usage message if you have not.<P>

<DT> <B> Stack Trace </B> <DD>

	Last, but not least, the OO layer uses the Carp module to give you
	a meaningful backtrace in the event of an error. Unlike the classic 
	function call interface, and error might occur and one of several
	points, the traceback functionality of Carp makes it more obvious
	where the error is occurring in your code.<P>
