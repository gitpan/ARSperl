 <H2>DelUsersFromGroup.pl</H2>

 <H3> Purpose </H3>

 This utility helps you remove one or more users from a specified group. It's
 most useful when removing many users from a group. Normally, you'd modify 
 each record in the User schema using the User Tool. With this script, you
 can specify all of the usernames to remove from the group and it will modify
 each User schema record for you.

 <H3> Notes </H3>

 You may need to run <code>arreload</code> after using this script to
 cause a reload of the group permissions.
