 <H2> Overview </H2>

 <B>ARSperl</B> is an integration kit for 
 <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl">Perl5.x</A> and 
 <A HREF="http://www.remedy.com">Remedy ARS</A> 2.x and 3.0 API. It 
 provides a subset of the functionality found in the ARS C API. The source
 code to the integration kit and example scripts is made available under the 
 <A HREF="copying.html">GPL</A>. <P>

 We hope that other ARS fans find the kit useful.

 <H2> Version </H2>

 The current release it Version 1.50 and will compile against ARS 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0
 API libraries.

 <H2> Release Notes </H2>

 <DL>
    <DT> 1.50 <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI> removed ars_errstr from C code. replaced with ars_errhash.
           modified ARS.pm to refer to hash when $ars_errstr is 
           accessed. $ars_errstr no longer tie'd to main:: package.
 
      <LI> bug fix (Sid Van den Heede) "affecting getting of
           displayInstanceList"
 
      <LI> bug fix (James LewisMoss) for ars_GetCharMenu()
 
      <LI> bug fix (Ian Flanigan) for perl_ARIndexStruct()
 
      <LI> modified GetListEntry(), GetEntry(), SetEntry() and 
           DeleteEntry() to make operations on join schemas 
           transparent.
 
      <LI> added a ARVerifyUser call to ars_Login so that
           ars_Login() || die() will work as one would expect it to.
 
      <LI> added $VERSION to the perl module file.
 
      <LI> added "log to file" action to GetFilter action hash 
           (requested by D.J.Adams@soton.ac.uk)
 
      <LI> added updated doc tree to main distribution (contributed by
           D.J.Adams@soton.ac.uk)
 
      <LI> new functions and doc on new functions and new examples for some
           of these new functions.
 
      <LI> altered return value of perl_ARStatusStruct so that it 
           returns a hash of the various StatusStruct members so that
           reversing the operation is simpler. scripts that, for example,
           retrieve active link definitions and print them out that previous
           expected the {message} key to point to a string will need to
           be updated.
 
      <LI> added valueType to the assign structure to assist in 
           reversing the operation (converting perl to C API assign 
           structure).

      <LI> added displayTag as an optional parameter to ars_LoadQualifier()
           so that you can build queries against customized views (that
           are stored on the server).
    </UL>
    <DT> 1.46 <DD>

    <DT> 1.44 <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI> added some extra code to assist in decoding
	   qualifier structures
      <LI> included PrintQual.pl and ars_QualDecode.pl examples
           to show how to do it.
      <LI> modified GetFilter.pl example to dump the qualification
           that is on the filter.
    </UL>

    <UL>

	    more efficient.

      <LI> New functions: ars_GetFilter(), ars_GetCharMenu(), 
		ars_GetServerStatistics

      <LI> Internal GetField call now caches results to minimize
		number of queries made.

    <DT> 1.22 <DD>
    <UL>
       <LI> fixed the bug in arsperl that caused SetEntry to not always work

 <H2> Support OS's </H2>

 The perl extension has only been tested on the following OS's:

 <UL>
     <LI> Solaris 2.x
     <LI> SunOS 4.x
     <LI> Irix
     <LI> HP-UX

 <H2> FAQs </H2>

 We have some <A HREF="http://smurfland.cit.buffalo.edu/ARSperl/FAQs/"> useful 
 excerpts from the mailing lists online.</A>

 <H2> Bug Reports </H2>

 If you come across a bug (i.e. it crashes with a SEGV or something like
 that) you can report them to: <P>

 <UL><CODE>arsperl-bugs@smurfland.cit.buffalo.edu</CODE></UL><P>

 Be sure to include the following information in your message: <P>
 <OL>  
  <LI> OS (operating system) version (example: Solaris 2.5)
  <LI> Perl version (example: 5.003)
  <LI> ARS version (example: 2.1.3)
  <LI> ARSperl version (example: 1.42)
  <LI> A fragment of the script that causes the crash. <BR>
       Example:
       <PRE>
       ars_CreateEntry($ctrl, $schema, $id, $val, $id2, $val2);
       </PRE>
  <LI> The values of any parameters that you pass to the call that
       fails. <BR>
       Example: 
       <PRE>
        $schema = "AD-Help Desk"
        $id = 12345678
        $val = "foo"
        $id = 24681357
        $val = "yadda"
       </PRE>
       The best way to obtain these values is to use a "print" statement
       <I>right before the call that fails</I>.
