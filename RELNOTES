1.0 Beta User Notes
-------------------

   o The library and extension seem fairly stable. However, bugs and
     memory leaks might still occur. We've only been able to build it
     under Solaris 2.x (4 and 5 to be specific) because that is what we
     run ARS under. Users who attempt builds on other systems and are
     successful should submit diffs back to us so that they can be 
     incorporated into the distribution.

   o The WEB client example works (more or less) but there is much 
     room for improvement. 

   o There is a mailing list available for people to share their 
     thoughts concerning ARSperl. To subscribe send email to 
     "majordomo@lurch.cit.buffalo.edu" with a body of "subscribe arsperl".
     The subject line is ignored.
