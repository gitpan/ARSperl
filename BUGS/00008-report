I seem to be running into a problem here, and I'm not sure why.

I'm using SetEntry to set a bunch of different fields after gathering info
from a web-based form. It works great for everything except for any enum'd
field.

 

For example - there is a field named "Accepted" containing:

0 => 'Yes'

1 => 'No'

 

If I attempt to set this field using

 

ars_SetEntry($rem,$schema,$ticket,0,$field1,$change1) ||

    die "Could not set entry: $ars_errstr";

 

It does not work. No error message back from Remedy, but the change is not
"saved".

 

Note that if I attempt to change it to something out of bounds (such as
passing a value of "2" or "maybe") I do get an error back stating that it is
out of the range of the particular field. This behaviour occurs on a any
enum-type field.

 

Has anyone seen behaviour like this? Any explanation for why this would be
happening?

 

Also, on a pseudo related note, I am unable to use ars_GetCharMenuItems to
retrieve menu items on either linux or windows 2k - segfault and app error
respectively.. any ideas or reported bugs wrt those fields? If not, I can work
around it, but I really really hate hardcoding these types of things.
