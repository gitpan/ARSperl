I'm trying to create a entry with an attachement.  The entry is being 
successfully created, however, the attachment is not actually getting 
attached.  No errors are being returned, an Entry Id is returned.  Part of 
the issue is that I've been unable to locate the documentation for creating 
an entry with an attachement flag.

>From the examples shipped with ARSperl 1.66 I have deduced that an 
attachement field requires its value passed as a hash of { file => "file 
name", size => file_size }.  Is this correct and is that all that is 
required?

Additionally I have noticed the following behaviour, calling ars_CreateEntry 
and passing the attachement data using:

$AttachementID, { file => "somefile", size => file_size } OR
$AttachementID, { 'file', "somefile", 'size', file_size } will cause a core 
dump.  However if I create the hash

%Val{ 'file', "somefile", 'size', file_size }; and then call ars_CreateEntry 
using: $AttachementID, $Val the script runs as expected, except of course 
that the file is not actually attached.

Thanks for the help.
