ars_CreateEntry() normally returns the entry ID created on success. 
 
When there are Messages from Filters, whether of Note, Warning or Error 
severity - no entry ID is returned by ars_CreateEntry(), even if the 
create was successful. And, dumping the entire %ars_errhash does not show 
the 
filter orginated message text. 
 
Anyone know how to get the Filter messages, and how to get the new entry ID?
