There are three conditions to detect after ars__MergeEntry(...).  

1. A non-null value returned means that a new entry was created.

2. A null value returned, plus $ars_errstr empty, means that an existing
   entry was replaced.

3. A null value returned, plus $ars_errstr non-empty, means there was some
   error.
