The return value of ars_GetListGroup is structured rather differently than
the corresponding return values from the ARGetListGroup API call.  (Hash of
parallel arrays rather than an array of hashes).  The current return values
seem relatively more difficult to deal with.  An even more natural return
value would be a hash keyed by the group id with the values being another
hash having groupName and groupType as keys.  I realize changing this would
break existing scripts, but IMNSHO a change is warranted.  Or is there a
logic to the current definition that I'm missing?  I'm willing to submit a
patch to make what ever change is desired.

Let me know what you think.
