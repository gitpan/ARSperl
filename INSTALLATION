---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a perl extension for Remedy's Action Request System. Remedy
Corporation, Action Request System, and AR System are trademarks of Remedy 
Corporation.

This extension is offered completely for free and without support
of any kind. Use at you own risk!  

PREPARATION

You will need to have these already installed: 

   o  ARS 2.x, 3.x, 4.x or 5.x API libraries and includes (header files).
   o  Perl 5.x with the dynamic loading option compiled in.

TESTED OS'S

This extension has been successfully built and used under the following 
OS versions:

   o  Solaris 2.4 - 8
   o  Irix 6.2
   o  HPUX*
   o  WindowsNT, 2000  (But NOT win95)
   o  Linux (RH 7.3, 8.0)

Users of other OS's might encounted problems with compiling. We'd be 
interested in hearing about your experiences and if you got it working
under a new OS. 

BUILDING

To build the extension, change into the root directory of the distribution
and edit the Makefile.PL file. Change the following lines in it to point to
the location of your ARS API directory (e.g. /u/remedy/api/lib)

$ARSAPI = "/usr/ars/api";

Under Sunos 4.1.x, you will also need to add -lntc to $ARS_LIBS.
Under Irix 6.2, you will need to remove the -lnsl option from $ARS_LIBS.
Under HP-UX, you will need to build it statically into Perl.
Under WindowsNT you will need to insert the appropriate libraries
(arapi.lib and nts.lib) from the API kit included with NT Server, 
and the path to the include files, into Makefile.pl (or the resulting
Makfile).  
For ARS2.0, you will need to add -DARS20 to the DEFINEs line.

then execute the following comands:

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install

The first command will construct a Makefile. 
The second comand will compile the source files.
The third command might require special (i.e. root) access if your
perl distribution is not owned by your userid.
