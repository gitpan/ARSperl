---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a perl extension for Remedy's Action Request System. Remedy
Corporation, Action Request System, and AR System are trademarks of Remedy 
Corporation.

This extension is beta, is offered completely for free and without support
of any. Use at you own risk!  

PREPARATION

You will need to have these already installed: 

   o  ARS 2.0 with API libraries.
   o  Perl 5.0 with the dynamic loading option compiled in.

TESTED OS'S

This extension has been successfully built and used under the following 
OS versions:

   o  Solaris 2.4, 2.5

Users of other OS's might encounted problems with compiling. We'd be 
interested in hearing about your experiences and if you got it working
under a new OS. 

BUILDING

To build the extension, change into the root directory of the distribution
and edit the Makefile.PL file. Change the following lines in it to point to
the location of your ARS API directory (e.g. /u/remedy/api/lib)

$ARS_LDPATH = "-L/ware/ars/api/lib";
$INCLUDES = "-I/ware/ars/api/include";

and execute the following comands:

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install

The first command will construct a Makefile. For the actual compile, an 
ANSI compatible C compiler is needed. We use GCC (2.7.0). The third command
might require special (i.e. root) access if your installed perl
distribution is not owned by your userid.  If you want to disable memory
deallocation with free, then add -DWASTE_MEM to the 'DEFINE' in writemakefile.

This is all that it takes to build and install the extension. Oh yeah... 
and a little luck too. :)
